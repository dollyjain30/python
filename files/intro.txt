File I/O in Python
File Input/Output (I/O) refers to reading data from and writing data to files. Python provides built-in functions to make this process straightforward. Working with files generally involves these steps:

Opening a file: You need to open a file before you can read from it or write to it. This creates a connection between your program and the file.
Performing operations: You can then read data from the file or write data to it.
Closing the file: It's crucial to close the file when you're finished with it. This releases the connection and ensures that any changes you've made are saved.
