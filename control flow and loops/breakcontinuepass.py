# Break
# The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely.
# Example:
# for i in range(10):
#     if i == 5:
#         break
#     print(i)  # Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Continue
# The continue statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.
# Example:
# for i in range(5):
#     if i == 2:
#         continue
#     print(i)  # Output: 0, 1, 3, 4

# Pass
# The pass statement is a placeholder that does nothing. It is used when syntax requires a statement but no action is needed.
# Example:
# for i in range(5):
#     if i == 3:
#         pass  # Do nothing
#     print(i)  # Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
