# If-Else Conditional Statements
# What are Conditional Statements?
# Conditional statements allow you to execute code based on certain conditions.
# Python uses if, elif, and else for decision-making.
# if condition1:
#     # Code to execute if condition1 is True
# elif condition2:
#     # Code to execute if condition2 is True
# else:
#     # Code to execute if all conditions are False
